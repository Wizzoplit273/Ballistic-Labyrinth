# Ballistic-Labyrinth
A 2D tank maze game in Godot inspired by Tank Trouble; my second Godot project; it's unfinished just like my other projects ;)

This project is mainly focused on introducing myself to networking.

Any random dude online can do what they want with this project, I'm new to Git and GitHub, so I barely have the skills for managing a repository.

Perhaps I'll change the license in the future, but as of now, 13th of November, 2025, it's simply without one.

This is also my first time publishing a software project online(excepting Scratch projects). I tried creating a couple repositories years ago but I wasn't bothered to learn how to use version controlling. I'm slightly more open to it now.

The "technical" version of this project at its first commit is a2.0, but the latest update recorded in the changelog is a1.7.1. The prefix a stands for alpha, so the game is on the alpha development stage.

I tried implementing a few multiplayer features; right now, player spawning perhaps works the best if the code gets more refined.

I'm interested in seeing anyone do a pull request or something. You could bring some insight on stuff. I would greatly appreciate meaningful contributions.

This is a free piece of software, so your interest on it should only be motivated by a passion for helping with whatever you can in the vast coding space online.

I'm currently a freshman in a computer engineering college and I feel the need to share what I've done in the past months during my free-time.

Since this project is made using the GDScript language, I would like it to remain like that for the sake of consistency.
Thank you for seeing my project!

Here are a few screenshots of the game:
